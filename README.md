# Tiger & Dragon PICO-8 A11y Port

This is an accessibility-focused port of [Tiger & Dragon](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/tiger-and-dragon/).

The goal is to test and validate [pico-a11y-template](https://github.com/JRJurman/pico-a11y-template),
an HTML template for PICO-8 games that allows for screen reader output.

## How to Run

To run locally, you can clone this repo and open the `a11y_page.html`.
Alternatively, you can go directly to [a11y_page.html](https://jrjurman.com/pico-tiger-and-dragon/a11y_page.html)
